## Project Challenges
-- HTML
Section 2 originally had a href for each images, but order wouldn't work and flex wrap would not function. Therefore, went back to using just images without a href. 

Organizing the footer containers and all divs within because I had different class elements for the icons,and the actual social media name.
Display block/flex would not work properly as desired. It was very challenging keeping icons only for mobile and aligning texts properly for tablet/desktop. 

-- CSS
Had issues, with the cascade effect and flex box issues with almost every section.
Learned the position of each line was important ex.( width, height) . Section 2, the images would not flex, after few tries. the first 3 images worked but would not wrap beside each other. 

There were lots of issues with height as well, trying to understand the difference in using % and px.

Using mobile first and focusing on the media queries last definitely helped keep things on track and organized personally.

--JS
Didn't know where to start. Went back and forth between in class lesson-slides, youtube,W3school and every javascript support sites available.

Understood the impact of forgetting brackets or any character.
Learned the use of camel style  for javascript variables.
Use of functions and if else was confusing because I didn't know when to use camel style and when not to at first.

Subscribe button took the whole day because of one spelling error. 

## Goals
Will continue progressing 
continue working on Javascript and allow shopping cart to function using arrays
